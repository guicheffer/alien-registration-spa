## Install
`make install` should install packages and dependencies

## Run
Please `make start` to have the project clean, to build and to run

**or**:
- `make build` should build the project in dev mode
- `make run` starts on _localhost_ in port `3000` 👉🏼 http://localhost:3000
- `make watch` watches for changes and compile needed code
- `make clean` clears the `app/` folder (responsible for the dist files)

## Demo

## Considerations

- I **do** love emojis ❤️

- Yep, I'm sure you're wondering (Can an Alien be multiple species at same time?). Answer is: YES! Aliens can be multiple type of species at the same time (I don't even know if that's possible 😷)

- Remove `localStorage` logical patterns and add an simple API to consume data and to be fetched as requested by user's actions.

- Modules its where actions and dispatchers are located

- IMO a good code doesn't need comments spread out.
